# Xpnss
Xpnss (Expenses) is a .Net 8 / Mongo API Solution to allow users to keep track of their spending accross one or more accounts.

!! It is currently in the very early stages, and is nowhere near being usable !!
This current version only includes the APIs. No UI is available.
As well, there is no User Management. Not sure if I will include it, or use an external service, either my own or a third party.

If you would like to try it, you will need to either have a running MongoDb server, or, reconfig the settings to use MongoDb via Aspire.
